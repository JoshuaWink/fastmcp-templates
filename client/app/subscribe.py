class SubscriptionClient:
    """
    Client for subscribing to and listening for streamed updates (e.g., progress, logs, events) via FastMCP or other sources.

    Areas of Responsibility:
    - Exposes server-provided fields (e.g., 'timestamp') transparently to the user.
    - Allows, but does not enforce, local annotation (e.g., 'received_at') for each message.
    - Provides a callback mechanism for context providers to shape, annotate, or format messages as needed.
    - Does not force any particular context structureâ€”supports opt-in, composable workflows.

        Subscribe to a topic (e.g., 'progress', 'logs') and listen for updates.

        If a callback is provided, it will be called with each new message.
        The callback can optionally annotate messages (e.g., add 'received_at') or compute elapsed time.
        Returns a SubscriptionHandle for manual polling or management.

        Example usage:
